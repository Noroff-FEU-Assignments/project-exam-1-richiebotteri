![image](/images/readme_image.jpg)

A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

## Description

In this website we where tasked to design a blog of choice to showcase all that we have learned this year. I choose to create a Fitness/Nutrition blog for this project.

In order to pass this exam we need to create the following:

### Homepage:

-  The home page should have a ‘Latest Posts’ section which uses a carousel (slider) for users to click to view more posts.

### Blog posts page:

-  The blog posts page should show the first 10 blogs, and the user should click to view more results which then show underneath the first 10 blogs.

### Blog specific page:

-  The content of the blog specific page should be dynamically built using a query string parameter based on whatever link the user clicked.
-  The title of the blog specific page should change based on the blog that has been clicked on e.g. “My Blog | An Article I Wrote”.
-  If images on the blog post page are clicked, a modal should appear giving the user a bigger view of that image. Clicking outside the image should hide the modal.

### Contact page

Create a contact us page with 4 textboxes on this page.

-  Name (Should be more than 5 characters long)
-  Email address (Must be a valid email address)
-  Subject (Should be more than 15 characters long)
-  Message content (Should be more than 25 characters long)

JavaScript should be used for validation, showing error messages if the values in the textboxes do not meet the requirements.

### WordPress

The content of the website will be stored on a WordPress installation used as a Headless CMS, to provide an API and add content for the blog.

## Built With

-  Html
